## AIM
To integrate and program temperature and accelerometer sensors in an embedded system for an electric vehicle (EV) simulation. The system monitors battery temperature and vehicle acceleration in real-time.
 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
•	MATLAB Software
•	Embedded System (ESP32, Arduino, or Simulated Data in MATLAB)
•	Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT11)
•	Accelerometer Sensor (e.g., MPU6050, ADXL345)
•	Serial Communication (for real sensors)
 
## THEORY
1. Temperature Monitoring in EVs
•	The battery temperature is crucial for safety and efficiency.
•	Excess heat can degrade battery performance and reduce lifespan.
•	A temperature sensor (e.g., LM35) provides real-time temperature monitoring.
2. Accelerometer for Motion Analysis
•	The accelerometer tracks vehicle movement and stability.
•	It measures acceleration in X, Y, and Z axes.
•	This data helps in suspension tuning, crash detection, and navigation.
3. Embedded System Integration
•	Data from sensors is acquired and processed using an embedded system.
•	The system can send alerts if temperature exceeds safe limits.
•	It can also detect sudden acceleration or braking for safety applications.
 
## PROCEDURE
🔹 Step 1: Sensor Simulation in MATLAB
