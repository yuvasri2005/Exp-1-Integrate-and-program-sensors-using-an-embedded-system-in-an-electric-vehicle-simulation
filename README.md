# Exp-1-Integrate-and-program-sensors-using-an-embedded-system-in-an-electric-vehicle-simulation

## AIM
To integrate and program temperature and accelerometer sensors in an embedded system for an electric vehicle (EV) simulation. The system monitors battery temperature and vehicle acceleration in real-time.
 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
â€¢	MATLAB Software
â€¢	Embedded System (ESP32, Arduino, or Simulated Data in MATLAB)
â€¢	Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35, DHT11)
â€¢	Accelerometer Sensor (e.g., MPU6050, ADXL345)
â€¢	Serial Communication (for real sensors)
 
## THEORY
1. Temperature Monitoring in EVs
â€¢	The battery temperature is crucial for safety and efficiency.
â€¢	Excess heat can degrade battery performance and reduce lifespan.
â€¢	A temperature sensor (e.g., LM35) provides real-time temperature monitoring.
2. Accelerometer for Motion Analysis
â€¢	The accelerometer tracks vehicle movement and stability.
â€¢	It measures acceleration in X, Y, and Z axes.
â€¢	This data helps in suspension tuning, crash detection, and navigation.
3. Embedded System Integration
â€¢	Data from sensors is acquired and processed using an embedded system.
â€¢	The system can send alerts if temperature exceeds safe limits.
â€¢	It can also detect sudden acceleration or braking for safety applications.
 
## PROCEDURE
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Sensor Simulation in MATLAB
â€¢	Simulate temperature variations using a sinusoidal function.
â€¢	Generate accelerometer readings in X, Y, and Z directions.
ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Plot Sensor Data
â€¢	Plot temperature variations over time.
â€¢	Plot acceleration data in X, Y, and Z axes.
ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Display Key Sensor Readings
â€¢	Print the final temperature and acceleration values.
